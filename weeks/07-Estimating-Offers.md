# Estimating Offers

## Topics

This week another Flocker will lead the discussion, UCSD graduate [Jeremy Schmitt](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~j2schmit). 
We will discuss estimating how many offers we will receive and introduce non-homogenous poisson process. In addition, we 
will cover some quick points on how we might numerically estimate this object.
