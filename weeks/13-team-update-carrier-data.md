# Review Fall Project Submissions

## Topics

This week each team discussed their project progress. We introduced the carrier data and carrier capacity entry data 
as additional data sets that could improve the offer decision engines the teams created. Lastly, Benson detailed a 
technique to create clusters of geographies using DBScan.
