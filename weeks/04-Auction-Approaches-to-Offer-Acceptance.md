# Freight Industry and Offer Acceptance 

## Homework due prior to class

Download the orders and offers datasets from Google Drive. The links should 
be in your email. Please reach out if you cannot locate the datasets.

Homework:
- For the FTL freight only, apply the [Secretary Approach we discussed in Week 2]({{"weeks/02-Freight-Basics-Offer-Acceptance" | absolute_url }}):
  - How much does this approach theoretically save over the historical 
    decisions?
  - Are there variants or slight tweaks that improve the results?
  - What limitations are there to this approach?
- For the PTL freight orders:
  - How do pools complicate application of the Secretary Problem?
  - How might we redesign the approach to make decisions on PTL offers?

## Topics

This week we will discuss the homework assignment and auction approaches to 
the problem.

Readings for the discussion 
TBD
