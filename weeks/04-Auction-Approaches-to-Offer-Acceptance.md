# Freight Industry and Offer Acceptance 

## Homework due prior to class

Download the [orders](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bXMKg5p1jrk8uvCxT5SYAlYXBOOCJcUy) and 
[offers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N74nU6cxXWkchkAj12eOHvMU7b5DIS9u) datasets from Google Drive. 
Please reach out if you cannot locate the datasets.

Homework:
- For the FTL freight only, apply the [Secretary Approach we discussed in Week 2]({{"weeks/02-Freight-Basics-Offer-Acceptance" | absolute_url }}):
  - How much does this approach theoretically save over the historical 
    decisions?
  - Are there variants or slight tweaks that improve the results?
  - What limitations are there to this approach?
- For the PTL freight orders:
  - How do pools complicate application of the Secretary Problem?
  - How might we redesign the approach to make decisions on PTL offers?

## Topics

This week we will discuss the homework assignment and auction approaches to 
the problem.
