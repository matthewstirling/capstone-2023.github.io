# Review Team Progress and Multi-armed Bandits

## Topics

This week each team discussed their project progress. Each team was asked to provide a summary of what models they
built and how those systems few into each other. A system design was shared that could serve as a guide in 
case teams are stuck. Additionally, we spent time outlining how teams could use multi-armed bandits to further enhance
the outcomes and production usefulness of their code.
