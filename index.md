# Introduction

Welcome to the 2022-2023 Capstone project. Here, you will find all the basic 
details for the Flock Freight section of the capstone class.

This domain of inquiry studies typical business problems within the freight 
industry. Specifically we'll investigate two problems:
* offer acceptance and auction marketplace theory
* next best actions modeling for carriers

# Schedule

The first half of the fall quarter will focus on understanding the 
freight industry, the specific problem of offer acceptance, and the specific
problem of determining an action to take with carriers. 

The latter-half of the fall quarter will introduce you to further topics,
like auction theory approaches and next best action models to inform possible
avenues for further research.
