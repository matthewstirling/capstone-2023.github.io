# Introduction

Welcome to the 2022-2023 Capstone project. Here, you will find all the basic 
details for the Flock Freight section of the capstone class.

This domain of inquiry studies typical business problems within the freight 
industry. Specifically we'll investigate offer acceptance and auction marketplace theory.

## Schedule

### Winter quarter

We will focus on revising our fall quarter project submissions and code to incorporate 
learnings from the 1st semester and the other team submission. Additionally, we'll add 
carrier-related data which should increase model performance. Lastly, we'll explore 
additional optimal stopping problem approaches. Much of the semester involves finalizing 
the presentation, poster, and report.

### Fall quarter

In the fall quarter we focused on understanding the freight industry,
the specific problem of offer acceptance, and the specific
problem of determining an action to take with carriers. 

The latter-half of the fall quarter will introduce you to further topics,
like auction theory approaches and next best action models to inform possible
avenues for further research.
